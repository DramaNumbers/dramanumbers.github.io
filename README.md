## Background

Like many others I have been subject to countless spam calls over the years and am just tired of them. On the search of an effective anti spam call measure, I came across the official German drama numbers. These are a set of landline and mobile numbers provided by the Bundesnetzagentur (Federal Network Agency) for media production, they are free to use by everyone and will never be assigned. This makes them perfect for giving away in situations, where you don't really trust the other party to keep your information secret, and therefore helps prevent spam calls in the future.

If you are interested in the official documents, take a look [here](https://www.bundesnetzagentur.de/SharedDocs/Downloads/DE/Sachgebiete/Telekommunikation/Unternehmen_Institutionen/Nummerierung/Rufnummern/Mittlg148_2021.html). I also want to give a shout-out to [Frank geht ran](https://digitalcourage.de/frank-geht-ran), which is another great anti spam call service by [digitalcourage](https://digitalcourage.de/) that actually answers the phone and informs the caller friendly but firmly that no contact is wanted.
